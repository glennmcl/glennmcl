## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a programmer in the industrial and manufacturing space. The main languages I write in are:
IEC 61131-3 ([Ladder diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_logic) , [Structured text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_text)) and [LabVIEW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW)

I am working on improving: my software version control, writing markdown files, python, and SQL.

Thanks for stopping by!
